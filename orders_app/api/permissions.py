    Permission class that allows PATCH requests only if the authenticated user
    is the business owner associated with the order.

    For HTTP PATCH operations, checks that `request.user` matches
    `order.business_user`. All other methods are permitted.

    Methods:

            Enforces ownership check for PATCH requests.
        has_object_permission(request, view, obj) -> bool:
